# Holidaze

Holidaze is a fictional local tourism agency in Bergen, Norway. The site was built to showcase my abilities in my final exam as a student at Noroff. It's my first 'real' webpage built using React, and was also my first time working seriously with TypeScript.

## Heads up

This project relies on icons I've purchased from FontAwesome. As such, it will not install unless you either add your own FontAwesome API token into your environment variables, or remove all icons entirely. If you do not have the pro version, you'll also need to install the free icons and replace all current imports of pro icons.

But you can easily do so by using search and replace in VSCode.
